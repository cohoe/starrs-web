IP <em>subnets</em> are the foundation of IMPULSE resources. IMPULSE controls the distribution of IP resources in the configured subnets.

To <em>create</em> a subnet, you need to enter the CIDR notation of your subnet (192.168.0.0/24). <em>Autogenerate</em> will fill in the IMPULSE data tables to allow for the distribution of resources. <em>Subnets</em> are assigned a specific <em>DNS Zone</em> to create forward/reverse records in.
