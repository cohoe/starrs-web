		<h1>Systems</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>A system is a physical device that exists within a datacenter. A system is configured with one or more Interfaces, which are used to communicate with your networks. Each interface is usually configured with one or more IP addresses, assigned from the resource that STARRS controls. These resources are usually configured by your system administrators. Your addresses are assigned to you for a given lease time. You will be notified when you need to renew your addresses, and you will need to do so otherwise they will be automatically removed and potentially assigned to other users. Your addresses can then be configured with DNS records within configured DNS zones.</p>
